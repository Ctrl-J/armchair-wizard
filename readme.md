## About

This repo houses the code for ArmchairWizard.com

The website is a portfolio/blog/playground for Jordan Marsh. There's much more to it than that.

## Details

- MEAN-ish stack
  - Redis/Postgres persistance, koa instead of express,
  react instead of angular... Soo, PKRN (dangit, no
  vowels!)
- Auto provisioning for consistency between development  
  and production.
- More to come...
